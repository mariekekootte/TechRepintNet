The distribution system is first converted to an equivalent single source network with radial configuration so that the conventional DistFlow branch equations can be used to solve the load flow problem. The network conversion process creates some break points and dummy buses. The characteristics of the original system are preserved by injecting appropriate complex power at the break points in the equivalent system. The injected powers are calculated and updated during the iteration process through a reduced order impedance matrix. The performance of the proposed method was investigated on three different test systems with various modifications.},

This paper presents the details of the network modeling and problem formulations used by Matpower, including its extensible OPF architecture. This structure is used internally to implement several extensions to the standard OPF problem, including piece-wise linear cost functions, dispatchable loads, generator capability curves, and branch angle difference limits. Simulation results are presented for a number of test cases comparing the performance of several available OPF solvers and demonstrating Matpower's ability to solve large-scale AC and DC OPF problems. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

However, in some cases, the conditions of the power systems are ill and the above-mentioned methods are poorly converged or even diverged. This paper presents application of corrected Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with a non-monotone line search for solving the PFP in the ill-conditioned power systems. The presented algorithm is evaluated on the case studies ranging from small to large (30-bus, 57-bus, 118-bus and 2383-bus). Simulation results show the proposed approach converges in all of the case studies. Moreover, application of the proposed method for solving the PFP in ill-conditioned power systems can significantly reduce the CPU time and number of iterations in comparison with the benchmark methods.},

However, these schemes are complicated and not easy to implement due to the absence of a slack bus as well as the dependence of the power on frequency as a result of the droop characteristics. This paper proposes simple and effective modifications to the conventional method (Newton Raphson) to compute the power flow for microgrids. The presented method provides a simple, easy to implement, and accurate approach to solve the power flow equations for microgrids. The proposed method is applied to two test systems: a 6-bus system and a 38-bus system. The results are compared against simulation results from PSCAD/EMTDC which validate the effectiveness of the developed method. The proposed technique can be easily integrated in current commercially available power system software and can be applied for power system studies.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a fast and robust load flow method for balanced power distribution systems with distributed generation sources. The method formulates the power flow equations in PQ decoupled form with polar coordinates. Second-order terms are included in the active power mismatch iteration, and resistances are fully modeled without any simplifications. The impacts of zero-impedance branches are explicitly modeled through reconfiguring of the adjacent branches with impedances. Typical distribution generation models and distribution load models are included. A hybrid direct and indirect solution technique is used to achieve efficiency and robustness of the algorithm. Active power correction is solved by means of a sparse LU decomposition algorithm with partial pivoting, and the reactive power correction is solved by means of restarted Generalized Minimal Residual algorithm with incomplete LU pre-conditioner. The numerical examples on a sample distribution system with widespread Photovoltaic installations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A new formulation is required to provide a proper power flow analysis in islanded microgrids taking into consideration their special philosophy of operation. In this paper, a novel and generic three-phase power flow algorithm is formulated for islanded microgrids. The algorithm is novel since it adapts the real characteristics of the islanded microgrid operation; i.e., 1) some of the distributed generation (DG) units are controlled using the droop control methods and their generated active and reactive power are dependent on the power flow variables; 2) the steady-state system frequency is considered as one of the power flow variables. The proposed algorithm is generic, where the features of distribution systems, i.e., three-phase feeder models, unbalanced loads and load models have been taken in consideration. Further, all possible operation modes of DG units (droop, PV, or PQ) have been considered. The problem has been formulated as a set of nonlinear equations. A globally convergent Newton-trust region method has been proposed to solve this set of nonlinear equations. The proposed algorithm is a helpful tool to perform accurate steady state studies of the islanded microgrid. Different case studies have been carried out to test the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {This paper presents an improvement in power flow calculation based on current injection method by introducing optimization factor. In the method proposed by this paper, the PQ buses are represented by current mismatches while the PV buses are represented by power mismatches. It is different from the representations in conventional current injection power flow equations. By using the combined power and current injection mismatches method, the number of the equations required can be decreased to only one for each PV bus. The optimization factor is used to improve the iteration process and to ensure the effectiveness of the improved method proposed when the systemis ill-conditioned. To verify the effectiveness of the method, the IEEE test systems are tested by conventional current injection method and the improved method proposed separately. Then the results are compared. The comparisons show that the optimization factor improves the convergence character effectively, especially that when the system is at high loading level and R/X ratio, the iteration number is one or two times less than the conventional current injection method. When the overloading condition of the system is serious, the iteration number in this paper appears 4 times less than the conventional current injection method.},

abstract = {Power flow analysis of distribution networks incorporating LV consumer representation needs to be cognizant of an unbalanced load structure and the grounding network between the consumer and network operator (TNC-S earthing). In this paper, the asymmetrical 3-phase (and neutral) power flow problem is solved by a correction current injection methodology applied to a system represented by a complex admittance matrix. The correction current injection technique is adopted to adjust the power exchange of shunt elements, whose nominal admittances are included in the system admittance matrix, through suitable fringing currents in the iteration process. This methodology offers an improved and more robust alternative for asymmetrical network scenarios under unbalanced power flow conditions when compared to the standard power flow methodologies, such as the Newton-Raphson or the forward-backward sweep approaches. These well-known methods may encounter convergence issues as a consequence of the specific consumer/network earthing arrangements especially when they need to be defined throughout the network. The algorithm presented here has been applied to a 4-wire representation of a suburban distribution network within Dublin city, Ireland, which incorporates consumer connections at single-phase (230 V N). The analysis presented uses the correction-current injection power flow algorithm in conjunction with the network model to consider the impact of distributed wind and solar (PV) generation systems (DwG and DpvG respectively), for a range of load profiles.},

By utilizing branch voltages as state variables, a constant Jacobian matrix can be obtained, and a building algorithm for Jacobian matrix is then developed from the observation of the constant Jacobian matrix. A solution technique, which takes the network structure into account to avoid the time-consuming lower and upper triangular (LU) factorization, is also developed. Since the factorization procedure can be avoided, the proposed method can save computation time. For any power system equipment, if its equivalent current injection or admittance matrix can be obtained, it can be integrated into the proposed method.

ThiS method has excellent convergence characteristics and is very robust. A computer program implementing this power flow solution scheme was developed and successfully applied to several practical distribution netwdrks with radial and weakly meshed structure. This program was also successfully used for solving radial and weakly meshed transmissioh networks. The method can be applied tb the solution of both the three-phase (unbalanced) and single-phase (balanced) representation of the netbork. In this paper, however, only the single phase representation is treated in detail.},

This paper presents an adaptive distributed power flow solution method based on the compensation-based method. The comprehensive distributed system model includes 3-phase nonlinear loads, lines, capacitors, transformers, and dispersed generation units. The numerical properties of the compensation-based power flow method are compared and analyzed under different situations, such as load unbalance, sudden increase of 1-phase loads, degree of meshed loops, number of generator nodes, and so on. Based on these analyses, an adaptive compensation-based power flow method is proposed that is fast and reliable while maintaining necessary accuracy. It is shown that this adaptive method is especially appropriate for simulation of slow dynamics.},

In this paper, the development of an unbalanced three-phase load flow algorithm that can handle multiple sources is described. This software is capable of switching the DG mode of operation from constant voltage to constant power factor. The algorithm to achieve this in the presence of multiple DGs is proposed. Shipboard power systems (SPS) have other special characteristics apart from multiple sources, which make the load flow difficult to converge. The developed software is verified for a distribution system without DG using the Radial Distribution Analysis Package (RDAP). The developed software analyzes an IEEE test case and an icebreaker ship system. System studies for the IEEE 37-node feeder without the regulator show the effect of different models and varying DG penetration related to the increase in loading. System losses and voltage deviations are compared.},

Mathematical models of the load, load connection, transformer, and distributed generation (DG) are presented. A three-phase power flow formulation is described for both power and current mismatch functions. Extended versions of the Newton power flow method are compared with the backward-forward sweep-based algorithm.

abstract = {The integration of new sources of energy like wind power, solar-power, small-scale generation, or combined heat and power in the power grid is something that impacts a lot of stakeholders: network companies (both distribution and transmission), the owners and operators of the DG units, other end-users of the power grid (including normal consumers like you and me) and not in the least policy makers and regulators. There is a lot of misunderstanding about the impact of DG on the power grid, with one side (including mainly some but certainly not all, network companies) claiming that the lights will go out soon, whereas the other side (including some DG operators and large parks of the general public) claiming that there is nothing to worry about and that it's all a conspiracy of the large production companies that want to protect their own interests and keep the electricity price high. The authors are of the strong opinion that this is NOT the way one should approach such an important subject as the integration of new, more environmentally friendly, sources of energy in the power grid. With this book the authors aim to bring some clarity to the debate allowing all stakeholders together to move to a solution. This book will introduce systematic and transparent methods for quantifying the impact of DG on the power grid. {\textcopyright} 2011 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.},

abstract = {Distributed generations (DGs) are generally modeled as PV or PQ nodes in power flow studies (PFSs) for distribution system. Determining a suitable model for each DG unit requires knowing the DG operation and the type of its connection to the grid (direct or indirect). In this respect, this paper offers a helpful list of DG models for PFSs. Moreover, an unbalanced three-phase power flow algorithm for radial distribution networks considering DG is presented based on the power summation method in backward/forward sweep technique. The proposed algorithm is simple and fast and can handle DG units in both PV and PQ mode. In comparison with the current analysis methods, handling of PV nodes in the proposed method is very simple since it uses active and reactive powers as flow variables rather than the complex currents and then checks the limits of reactive power of the generator of PV node straightforwardly. IEEE four-node test feeder is used to validate the proposed method. IEEE 13-node test feeder without regulator and with different DG models is analyzed and the results are presented. Moreover, the results are compared with and without considering system losses. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The significant penetration of Distributed Generation(DG) systems in electrical power industry is mainly driven by the ever increasing demand for electrical power and growing environmental concerns. Power Flow Studies play a vital role in planning the future expansion of power system as well as for deciding the optimum operation of the existing power system. The ill conditioned nature of distribution system as well as unbalanced nature of DG sources demand unbalanced power flow studies for analysing the DG integrated distribution system. For the power flow studies, DGs can be modelled as either PQ or PV nodes based on the type and interconnection method to the grid. The paper presents an unbalanced power flow algorithm based on the current summation method for the distribution system with the DGs modelled either as PQ or PV node. Handling of PV nodes is done with the help of the sensitivity impedance matrix. The proposed algorithm is validated with IEEE 13 bus distribution feeder},

@article{Farag2011,
abstract = {In this paper, the element incidence matrix has been extended to develop a comprehensive three-phase distribution system power flow program for radial topology. Three-phase overhead or underground primary feeders and double-phase or single-phase line sections near the end of the feeder laterals have been considered. Unbalanced loads with different types including constant power, constant current and constant impedance are modeled at the system buses. Substation voltage regulator (SVR) consisting of three single phase units connected in wye or two single-phase units connected in open delta are modeled to satisfy the desired voltage level along the feeder. The mathematical model of distributed generation (DG) connected as PQ and PV buses are integrated into the power flow program to simulate the penetration of DGs in the distribution systems. The proposed method has been tested and compared with different IEEE test feeders result. The developed algorithm has been used to study the impact of both SVR and high penetration of DG on voltage profile and system power losses.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a very simple and efficient method of load flow calculation for a general distribution system having mesh network with more than one feeding node. The distribution system is first converted to an equivalent single source network with radial configuration so that the conventional DistFlow branch equations can be used to solve the load flow problem. The network conversion process creates some break points and dummy buses. The characteristics of the original system are preserved by injecting appropriate complex power at the break points in the equivalent system. The injected powers are calculated and updated during the iteration process through a reduced order impedance matrix. The performance of the proposed method was investigated on three different test systems with various modifications.},
